-Goal-

Create a Pomodoro timer. The pomodoro timer will follow the classic pattern of 4 rounds of 25 minutes with a 3-5 minute break and then after 4 rounds a break of 15-30 minutes.


Assumptions

  -> The Application is a single user application and information does not need to be shared with anyone else.
  -> The Developer has full discretion on the user experience and interface.
  -> The code must be checked in to a public Github repository.
  -> The code must have tests
  -> Please explain how to install and run your application in the README.md
  

Requirements

  # User Story

  1	As a user, I must be able to easily start the timer.
  2	As a user, I must be alerted when there is no more time left on the timer.
  3	As a user, I may be able to view the remaining time of the timer.


User interaction and design

  It is up the discretion of the developer how the user will interact 
  with this application. Potential types of user experiences could be 
  an Alexa Skill, Web Page, Mobile Application, API, or Console 
  Application.
